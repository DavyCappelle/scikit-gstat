Welcome to SciKit GStat's documentation!
========================================

At current state, this module offers a scipy-styled `Variogram` class for
performing geostatistical analysis. This class can be used to derive
variograms. Key benefits are a number of semivariance estimators and theoretical
variogram functions. The module is planned to be hold in the manner of scikit
modules and be based upon `numpy` and `scipy` whenever possible. There is
also a distance matrix extension available, with a function for calculating
n-dimensional distance matrices for the variogram.

.. note::

    Scikit-gstat was rewritten in major parts. Most of the changes are internal,
    but the attributes and behaviour of the `Variogram` has also changed
    substantially.
    A detailed description of the new versions usage will follow. The last
    version of the old Variogram class, 0.1.8, is kept in the `version-0.1.8`
    branch on GitHub, but not developed any further. It is not compatible to
    the current version.
